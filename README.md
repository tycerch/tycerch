# 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Tycer

📊 I'm a data analyst based in Portland with 18+ years of experience in data-driven operations in supply chain and EdTech domains.

🧩 I enjoy exploring new technologies and datasets, telling compelling stories with data and creating tools to solve complex business challenges. Currently looking for new opportunities where I can bring my unique blend of technical skills and deep domain expertise.

💡 **My story:** Started as a supply chain planner/analyst at an EdTech company where I transformed their supply chain and operations. I evolved into their lead data analyst, where I architected BI infrastructure and led a major data warehouse effort. This involved normalizing and enriching customer and prospect profiles, enabling new marketing and sales strategies.
